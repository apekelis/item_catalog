# Item Catalog Project
2nd Project in FSWD Udacity course

Created from the repository in the oauth2 udacity course into a new repository (That's why there are all the previous commits before the start of the project)
# Tools needed to run project

### VirtualBox

VirtualBox is the software that actually runs the VM. [You can download it from virtualbox.org, here.](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)  Install the *platform package* for your operating system.  You do not need the extension pack or the SDK. You do not need to launch VirtualBox after installing it.

**Ubuntu 14.04 Note:** If you are running Ubuntu 14.04, install VirtualBox using the Ubuntu Software Center, not the virtualbox.org web site. Due to a [reported bug](http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2227131), installing VirtualBox from the site may uninstall other software you need.

### Vagrant

Vagrant is the software that configures the VM and lets you share files between your host computer and the VM's filesystem.  [You can download it from vagrantup.com.](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads) Install the version for your operating system.

**Windows Note:** The Installer may ask you to grant network permissions to Vagrant or make a firewall exception. Be sure to allow this.

## Fetch the Source Code and VM Configuration

**Windows:** Use the Git Bash program (installed with Git) to get a Unix-style terminal.  
**Other systems:** Use your favorite terminal program.

From the terminal, run:

    git clone https://github.com/apekelis/item_catalog.git catalog

This will give you a directory named **catalog** complete with the source code for the flask application, and everything you need to run it

## Run the virtual machine!

Using the terminal, change directory to catalog (**cd catalog**), then type **vagrant up** to launch your virtual machine.

After that you can check if all the required packages and dependencies are installed for this project in the Virtual machine by using the **requirements.txt** file:

	pip  install  -r  requirements.txt


## Running the Item Catalog App
Once it is up and running, type **vagrant ssh**. This will log your terminal into the virtual machine, and you'll get a Linux shell prompt. When you want to log out, type **exit** at the shell prompt.  To turn the virtual machine off (without deleting anything), type **vagrant halt**. If you do this, you'll need to run **vagrant up** again before you can log into it.


Now that you have Vagrant up and running type **vagrant ssh** to log into your VM.  change to the /vagrant directory by typing **cd /vagrant**. This will take you to the shared folder between your virtual machine and host machine.

Type **ls** to ensure that you are inside the directory that contains catalog.py, database_setup.py, and two directories named 'templates' and 'static'

Now type **python database_setup.py** to initialize the database.

Type **python database_fill_in.py** to populate the database with some categories and items. (Optional)

Type **python catalog.py** to run the Flask web server. In your browser visit **http://localhost:8000** to view the item catalog app.  You should be able to view categories and items, and after loggin in you can also add, edit, and delete the items you created.
